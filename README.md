# Following Addition And Changes To Openstreetmap
In the next big update for Openstreetmap, the following details that will add changes and addition to the editor mode will include:

* The maximum amount of charactors in Description and Notes (both in Inspect Menu and outside unresolve/resolve notes) will be unlimitedable, allowing users to create longer text as they want.

* Added formats to Descriptions and Notes in Inspect Menu: Bold (by putting two asterisks or underscores on both sides, in shortcut, press Control + B key), Italic (by putting one asterisk or underscore on both sides, in shortcut, press Control + I key), Strikethrough (by putting two hyphens on both sides, in shortcut, press Control + Underscore & Hyphen key), Headings (Heading 1, 2, and 3 by putting number signs behind text), Superscript and Subscript (by putting one backtick and one Tilde on both sides).

* Confirmed Users are **the type of registered users who were granted after the account was verified after creating it.** The JOSM moderators cannot undo edits and block confirmed users, but unconfirmed users (also simply known as registered users) with an account without verifying it, they can undo edits and block them individually.

* Users can now delete a feature if there's not enough of current visibility from the screen, and even create and edit features outside of the current mode.

* The snaping tools option will be added to the editor mode, so users can measure the angle of making smooth parallel lines and areas, dots to not created when line and or area intersects with another or each other, angle grid for lines and area, and such more.
